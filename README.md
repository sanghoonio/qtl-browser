# qtl-browser

Static browser for the TOPCHeF cis/trans eQTL and sQTL summary statistics (Murray et al. 2026,
medRxiv 10.64898/2026.01.12.26343934), with the Jurgens et al. 2024 DCM GWAS alongside for
colocalization views. All queries run in the browser with DuckDB-WASM over range-read parquet;
there is no server.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `data/raw/` | `sources.yaml` lists every input (Zenodo QTL archives, GENCODE v34, dbSNP b157, DCM GWAS) with URLs, versions, and checksums; `download.py` fetches and verifies them. Everything else here is gitignored. |
| `pipeline/` | Python build that turns `data/raw/` into browser-ready parquet in `data/derived/`, plus `manifest.json`. `config.yaml` holds paths, the significance rule, window sizes. `figures.py` makes quick-look PNGs. |
| `ui/` | Vite + React + TypeScript app: Tailwind 4 and DaisyUI 5, DuckDB-WASM, Mosaic/vgplot plots. |
| `plans/` | Dated plans with decision ledgers and implementation logs. |

## Setup

```bash
uv sync                              # python deps
data/raw/download.py                 # ~45 GB of inputs; resumable, md5-verified
uv run python -m pipeline build      # -> data/derived/ (~7 GB), skips finished steps
uv run python -m pipeline validate   # counts vs the preprint, rsID checks, row-group pruning

cd ui && npm install
npm run dev                          # serves ../data/derived at /data with Range support
npm run build && npm run preview     # production bundle, same data plugin
```

`ui/.env.production` points production builds at the R2 bucket through `VITE_DATA_BASE`;
`VITE_DATA_BASE= npm run build` (empty) makes a bundle that reads `/data` on its own origin.

## Deploy

```bash
# .env at the repo root (gitignored): R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID and R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
# an R2 API token with Object Read & Write on the bucket. Run from the repo root.
uv run python -m pipeline.upload cors                # CORS rule from pipeline/config.yaml
uv run python -m pipeline.upload sync --dryrun       # then without --dryrun; re-runnable
uv run python -m pipeline.upload check               # HEAD + range GET on the public URL
```

Bucket, endpoint, public URL, allowed origins, and excludes are the `r2:` block in
`pipeline/config.yaml`. Setting the CORS policy needs an Admin token or the dashboard
(`upload.py cors --print` gives the JSON to paste).

The UI is a Cloudflare Workers static-assets project built from the repo: root directory
`ui`, build `npm run build`, deploy `npx wrangler deploy`, with `ui/wrangler.jsonc` naming
`dist` and the single-page-application fallback. Workers caps assets at 25 MiB, so the DuckDB
wasm modules are not bundled; the app loads DuckDB-WASM's jsDelivr bundles, as drumbeat-viewer
does.

## Data notes

- Coordinates GRCh38; genes GENCODE v34; rsIDs from dbSNP by position and alleles.
- eGene / sQTL intron: permutation p < 0.05, the preprint's wording (10,220 eGenes vs the
  paper's 10,241; 13,540 sQTL introns, exact).
- Nominal cis tables are one row group per gene, so a gene page fetches only its own bytes.
- eQTL nominal rows are kept for every tested gene; sQTL nominal rows only for the 13,540
  significant introns (`sqtl_nominal` in `pipeline/config.yaml`), which keeps the bucket near
  7 GB for the R2 free tier instead of 16. Every intron keeps its permutation row.
- The 21 eQTL and 4 sQTL colocalized genes are hard-coded from the authors' list until the coloc
  tables (PP.H4, sentinels) are shared; `coloc.parquet` is an empty stub for them.
- DCM GWAS: Jurgens 2024 biobanks-only meta-analysis (5,022 cases / 932,941 controls), the set
  the preprint's figures were drawn from although its Methods cite the full meta-analysis
  (9,365 / 946,368). Position-sorted parquet for LocusCompare plus a 5 Mb-binned table for
  the landing track; `pipeline/config.yaml` `dcm_gwas` picks the file, and the full-meta build
  is parked at `data/derived/_full/gwas_meta/`.
